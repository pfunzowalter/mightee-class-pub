# MIGHTEE-CLASSIFICATION WITH MACHINE LEARNING 
Radio synchrotron emission originates from both massive star formation and black hole accretion, two processes that drive galaxy evolution. Efficient classification of sources dominated by either process is therefore essential for fully exploiting deep, wide-field extragalactic radio continuum surveys. In this study, we implement, optimize, and compare five widely used supervised machine-learning (ML) algorithms to classify radio sources detected in the MeerKAT International GHz Tiered Extragalactic Exploration (MIGHTEE)â€“COSMOS survey as star-forming galaxies (SFGs) and active galactic nuclei (AGN). Training and test sets are constructed from conventionally classified MIGHTEE-COSMOS sources, and 18 physical parameters of the MIGHTEE-detected sources are evaluated as input features. As anticipated, our feature analyses rank the five parameters used in conventional classification as the most effective: the infrared-radio correlation parameter ($q_\mathrm{IR}$), the optical compactness morphology parameter (class$\_$star), stellar mass, and two combined mid-infrared colors. By optimizing the ML models with these selected features and testing classifiers across various feature combinations, we find that model performance generally improves as additional features are incorporated. 
Overall, all five algorithms yield an $F1$-score (the harmonic mean of precision and recall) $>90\%$ even when trained on only 20\% of the dataset. Among them, the distance-based $k$-nearest neighbors classifier demonstrates the highest accuracy and stability, establishing it as a robust and effective method for classifying SFGs and AGN in upcoming large radio continuum surveys.

## I have divided the work in this repo into a series of experiments as follows
1) EXP1 - The data preprocessing and feature visualization notebooks - In these notebooks we do the data cleaning and ensure its free from missingness, defined the spectroscopic features that we going to use as input features.
2) EXP2 - These are Feature Analysis notebooks. We perform feature analysis using Corelation Matrix, SeaBorn Pair plot and Permutation Importance and ROC curves. We also do the t-sne experiments on the 2.1t-sne notebook
3) EXP3 - This a Data Corelation notebook. We make a plot of two features for each target label. Using simple stats such as pearson's corelation we asses the corelation of each pair of features.
4) EXP4 - We now adopt the machine learning algorithms mentioned above and do classification. We also went on to balance the data and redo calculation to asses if data imbalance has significant effect in this classification problem
5) EXP5 - In this section I adopted eslam code to classify MIGHTEE sources using the simple statistics as Mahalanobis distance.
6) EXP6 reference - This serves as a machine learning reference note book. If you would like to know how the code is run to produce results in "EXP6_final_results" notebook it is could be worth looking but the results contained are also in "EXP6_final_results notebook".
6) **EXP6 Final**- This is an important notebook where we compare all the supervised machine learning algorithms. We applied different machine learning algorithms in different combination of features and different train size on classifying AGNs or SFGs.
7) EXP_autoencoder - all these are experiments related to test if using an autoencoder to reduce the a certain number of features to two could help improve the stability of some models such as tsne same as tsne.
8) Other notebooks are just supporting our main results and are included in the appendix of our paper.

EXP4, EXP5, EXP6 makes use of the code adopted from "Hussein, E.A.; Thron, C.; Ghaziasgar, M.; Vaccari, M.; Marnewick, J.L.; Hussein, A.A.
